    <p>There is plenty camping available all over the Burren but it does get crowded.  There is limited space available in the field on the sea side of the road just down from Ballyryan for parking vans and camping.  There are no faciities here. it is basically wild camping so we are counting on the goodwill of the landowners to allow us to camp here overnight.  This can be quite busy if there is fine weather as there are a lot of people who use the area for fishing trips also.  Please be respectful of others and ensure you take all your rubbish away with you if you do decide to camp here. </p>
    <table align="center">
      <tr><td>For those of you who would prefer to camp in a quieter area where there are facilities  <a href="https://www.boghill.com/">The Boghill Centre </a> also has camping space or if you want to book somewhere more luxurious they also have very comfortable rooms at a reasonable rate.There is also a campsite in Doolin and Fanore which are villages on either side of the climbing area so take your pic.  Fanore also has a nice beach with sand dunes that is popular with campers.</td>

  <h2>More Info</h2>

  	<h3>Coffee Coffee Coffee</h3>
  		<p><img src="images/coffee.jpg" alt="Mobile Coffee Van" class="small-left-img">It is well known that coffee and climbing are two sides of the same coin, coffee makes climbing better and climbing enhances your coffee experience.  We have organised for our very own coffee slave, Dave, to come and brew our coffees from morning until late afternoon daily from his mobile coffee van.  Make sure to bring your own cup and some coinage as it is cash only. <em>"Quirky, quick and quality!  Best coffee I've had in years" Coffee Connioisseur</em></p>

  	<h3>Meal Deal</h3>
  		<p><img src="images/fish.jpg" alt="Fish and Chips" class="small-right-img">There is plenty options to choose from for dining but the Doolin Hotel have kindly offered to do Fish and Chips for climbers attending the festival for a discounted rate of €10 with a pint included.  This offer is available from Friday to Sunday night.  Just use the enquiries email address on the <a href="contact.html">Contact Us</a> page to reserve a token for you.  </p>

   	<h3>Shuttle Bus</h3>
  		<p>There will be a shuttle bus running from the crag to Doolin Friday, Saturday and Sunday from 6pm to ferry climbers to the village for an evening meal and for the talks.  This is to ensure people can have a drink and not worry about driving or parking their car again as parking can be tight and queueing to park causes traffic jams.  We really want to keep congestion by the crag to a minimum.  The cost for the shuttle bus is €5 return and you can just pay the driver.  </p>
