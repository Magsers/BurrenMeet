      <td>If you are new to the Burren and are unaware of what you will need for the festival we have put together a list of items you may need and which may be useful to you.  The Burren can vary from other crags because of the type of rock which determines a few factors in what you need to bring.  </td>

    <ul>
      <li> <strong>Your climbing rack, rockshoes, harness, chalkbag and lead rope. </strong><br>We assume everyone attending the festival will have their own gear.  Some of our sponsors will be setting up stalls to demo some climbing gear so there may be some items for sale but we cannot guarantee what will be in supply.</li>
      <div class="sidenote">Please be aware that cams aren't as useful in the limestone of the Burren because it is a permeable rock and so they can slip out.  More experienced climbers do use them carefully but a set of nuts is more useful than cams in the Burren.</div>  
      <li><strong>A rope protector </strong>as the rock is extremely abrasive and not good for the ropes.  We will set up some abseils which will be in situ for the weekend.</li>
      <li> <strong>Camping gear,</strong> tent, sleeping bag, warm clothes, cooking equipment, utensils, rubbish bags, toilet roll, torch, sunscreen, food and water.</li>
      <li><strong>Money </strong>for food, coffee, shuttlebus and donations for the speakers.  Also there will be some sales reps selling a small selection of climbing gear and attire.</li>
      <li>Try to partner up with a <strong>climbing buddy</strong> prior to arrival.  It's always easier if you have made these arrangements before any climbing trip.</li>
      <li><strong>The Burren Guidebook</strong>.  You can view the routes on <a href="http://www.climbing.ie">Climbing.ie</a> but there may not always be mobile reception so either print out the Burren section or bring/buy the guidebook.</li>
      <li><strong>Warm Clothes</strong>.  It is a sea cliff location and it can get very breezy even in summer months.</li>

  <h2>More Info</h2>

  	<h3>Coffee Coffee Coffee</h3>
  		<p><img src="images/coffee.jpg" alt="Mobile Coffee Van" class="small-left-img">It is well known that coffee and climbing are two sides of the same coin, coffee makes climbing better and climbing enhances your coffee experience.  We have organised for our very own coffee slave, Dave, to come and brew our coffees from morning until late afternoon daily from his mobile coffee van.  Make sure to bring your own cup and some coinage as it is cash only. <em>"Quirky, quick and quality!  Best coffee I've had in years" Coffee Connioisseur</em></p>

  	<h3>Meal Deal</h3>
  		<p><img src="images/fish.jpg" alt="Fish and Chips" class="small-right-img">There is plenty options to choose from for dining but the Doolin Hotel have kindly offered to do Fish and Chips for climbers attending the festival for a discounted rate of €10 with a pint included.  This offer is available from Friday to Sunday night.  Just use the enquiries email address on the <a href="contact.html">Contact Us</a> page to reserve a token for you.  </p>

   	<h3>Shuttle Bus</h3>
  		<p>There will be a shuttle bus running from the crag to Doolin Friday, Saturday and Sunday from 6pm to ferry climbers to the village for an evening meal and for the talks.  This is to ensure people can have a drink and not worry about driving or parking their car again as parking can be tight and queueing to park causes traffic jams.  We really want to keep congestion by the crag to a minimum.  The cost for the shuttle bus is €5 return and you can just pay the driver.  </p>
