            <td>There will be a number of talks held in Doolin Hotel Friday and Saturday evening.  There is no need to book for these events and they are free of charge.  However we will put a donation box on the door in order to contribute to the cost of booking the room and the travel expenses for the spearkers.  We'd also like to buy them all a drink for their time.  We will run a shuttle bus to and from the crag before and after the talks.  The cost for this is â‚¬5 return which you can pay the driver.  There will be no talks on Sunday night.  The following is the schedule :</td>
